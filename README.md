In this assignment, I have made the given webpage more semantic friendly.

To start, I broke all the div's down and broke them into sections so it was easier to follow along.

After that, given the following resource:\
  https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp \
I was able to recognize some of the tools I can use in my HTML code.

For example, I was able to recognize I could use the "aside" tool and copy the format form the old code and use it in my aside section.
From there, I consolidated as much as I could for the images in the CSS file (making them into 1 class rather than 3 separate ones doing the same thing) and added the whole main content to wrap around the body.
For example, I had combined the 3 images classes in the main section into 1 class, and the 3 images classes on the side panel into 1 class.

From the instructions, I have:\
[x] Made sure all links work correctly\
[x] Merged all CSS styles with similar styles\
[x] Commented my CSS files properly\
[x] Created a gitHUB page to run the webpage\
[x] Uploaded the index file to gitHUB\
[x] Made a similar webpage given to me\
[x] Repository has a unique name\
[x] Repository follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.\
[x] Repository contains multiple descriptive commit messages\

Bonus:\
-found a color change in the heading, fixed\
-link was broken for one of the tabs
